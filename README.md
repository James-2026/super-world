The code has comments explaining step by step
it installes required dependencies using the fedora package manager 
creates files for each code language that gets printed 
then echos the required code into a redirection that copies it into the related file.
then either permissions are changed to create an executable or the code is compiled into an executable
finally the code is executed
the world gets one super hello.
